# Quantitative Risk Modeling Platform

This is a comprehensive quantitative risk modeling platform for the banking sector built with Python, FastAPI, and Streamlit.

## Architecture
- Backend: FastAPI with advanced mathematical models (VaR, CVaR, Monte Carlo simulations)
- Frontend: Streamlit for interactive risk dashboards
- Database: PostgreSQL for data storage, Redis for caching
- Mathematical Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, QuantLib, PyMC3

## Key Features
- Value at Risk (VaR) calculations using multiple methodologies
- Conditional VaR (Expected Shortfall) analysis
- Monte Carlo simulations for portfolio risk assessment
- Stochastic Differential Equations modeling
- Real-time risk monitoring and visualization
- Stress testing and scenario analysis

## Development Guidelines
- Follow modular architecture with separate layers for data processing, risk engines, API, and frontend
- Use proper mathematical validation for all risk calculations
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- Follow banking industry risk management best practices
- Ensure scalability and performance optimization for large portfolios
- Maintain professional code standards and documentation
- Use conventional commit message format for all changes
